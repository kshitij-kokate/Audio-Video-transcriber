I want 365 cars, one for each day of the year. I want 5 homes at Private Jett and 20 bank accounts. The teacher said Varun, I did not ask you to write an essay. I just asked what you wanted to be. Varun, teacher then turned to a girl who's name was Pooja. Sir, please don't answer in this essay form. Tell me two words what do you want to be when you grow up? Pooja said Varun's wife. Right. Let Varun do all the hard work. Yes, I will all do money. Get married. Life is sorted. You smash it, you nail it."
